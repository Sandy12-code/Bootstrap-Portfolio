                <p>Working as a Cyber Security Sales Engineer for 2 years at BAE Systems, I felt compelled to helping organizations improve their abilities to effectively detect threats and drive Information security. 
                    I also strove to do better every single day in order to put a smile on my clients' faces and develop enduring, meaningful relationships with each of them. This allowed me to create value for my clients beyond solving the issue at hand.
                    A strong work ethic and a never ending positive attitude has been key to my success.
                </p>
                <p>I am currently enrolled in George Washington University Coding Bootcamp, pursuing a Full Stack Web Development diploma, in order to enhance my hands-on technical skills.
                    Whenever I am not glued to my computer, I spend time with my 5yr old daughter cooking.
